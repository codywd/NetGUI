0.7.7
1. Fixed the various GI Import issues regarding require_version
2. Hardcoded image paths to ensure they always show.
3. Fixed GtkSourceView errors.

0.7.6   
1. Fix the fact that NetGUI could no longer scan.

0.7.4
1. Fixed misspelling. Device spelt as deviec
2. Should now detect all wireless devices (it seems all wireless devices start with wl, instead of just wlp or wlan.)

0.7.3
1. Fixed issue #37
   
0.7.2
1. Fixed issue with setup.py, where it installed images to incorrect directory.

0.7

2. Fixed issue where wpa_cli ignored the NetGUI selected interface, even if set through preferences
3. Changed dependency from notify-osd to notification-daemon. While I encounter issues if I DON'T use notify-osd, I will change it because it is a popular request.
4. If a profile already exists, use it, and don't make a new one.
5. Change to NoWifiMode through Menu (called Switch to Profile View)

Known issues for 0.7:
1. Preferences dialog does not work (except for preferred interface)

1. Finishing touches on No wifi Mode.

0.6.5
1. Manually change interface via preferences dialog.

the same abilities.

0.6
1. Removed dependency for wireless-tools
2. Changed scanning method to wpa_cli

0.4
1. Changed NetCTL to use "_" inbetween it's name and the name of the network when creating a profile, instead of "-", because of how systemd treats "-" as a special character.
2. Fixed a bug where every network was either "Open" or "WEP." It now correctly states "WPA" if that is what it is.
3. Fixed the column layout. Basically, "Connection Quality" listed the security type, and "Security Type" listed the connection quality.
4. Fixed the "Connected?" column to correctly state if you are connected to a network.
